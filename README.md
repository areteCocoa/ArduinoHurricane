## star_wars
Play the main theme of Star Wars with the buzzer.

## sketch_jan08a
This program takes 3 different lights and lights them in ascending and descending order based on the time delay. They strobe back and forth

## sketch_jan09a
This program takes a light sensor and translates the value received via analog input and translates it to a buzzer. The switch cases at the bottom allow for more "auto-tunning".

## sketch_jan12a
This program takes 3 different lights and lights them in ascending and descending order based on the time delay. They strobe back and forth. Once the light "reaches" a side, they will play a song

## sketch_jan12b
This program is for the light recording device. It is currently in development. 
This program will perform the following using an arduino lillypad:
1. Read in whether or not a person is inside/outside.
2. Record how long said person is inside/outside.
3. Alert the user via sound and/or light sensors indicating how long a person has been outside.
   - Three lights will display "safe", "mild", "Dangerous". These will display how damaging the sun is without sunscreen
   - One buzzer to give a musical song played at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes intervals.
